## Using DE, Gene Co-expression and Functional Enrichment Analyses to Find Significant Genes, Pathways and Biological Process for Crohn’s Disease
### Abstract
Crohn’s disease (CD) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes
inflammation in different areas in the digestive tract. CD research is active nowadays, and it is already known that genetics play a significant role in the CD appearance. In this work, we perform Differential Expression Analysis (DEA) on RNA-seq reads of coding RNA and Gene Co-Expression Analysis using the WGCNA package. The analyses were done on samples from 36 Crohn’s patients and 32 controls. Dataset was obtained from our reference paper (Abnormal Small Intestinal Epithelial Microvilli in Patients With Crohn's Disease, by VanDussen et al.). Our main focus is not to reproduce the reference paper results, since a dataset of microvilli length wasn’t supplied, but to create sets of significant genes with the help of the DEA and Co-expression analyses, and further investigate these sets by functional enrichment analysis. This above recent analysis resulted in substantial enrichment of the IL-17 signaling pathway, and of mitochondrial processes such as mitochondrion organization and mitochondrial electron transport. These findings were backed up by academic recent papers, as well as other significant genes associated with CD that we reveal along our work. Our findings strengthen recent papers hypotheses and findings, especially in cases where our findings were obtained in different ways than in these papers.
